Ditz now works from project subdirectories, and you can have a .ditz-config in
the project root for project-specific configuration. (This is not merged with
the global config, so this file overrides everything in ~/.ditz-config.)

You can specify an :issue_dir key in this file, which can be a relative path to
the directory containing project.yaml. So if you want to rename that directory,
or keep it somewhere else, now you can.

There's also a new hook system for plugging in your own code. Run ditz -l to
see a list of available hooks.

In ditz 0.2, we store issues per file. This avoids many unnecessary conflicts
that occur in the single-file case.

To upgrade your bugs.yaml to a bugs/ directory, you must run
ditz-convert-from-monolith.
